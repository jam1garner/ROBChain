# ROBChain
PoC exploit for Super Smash Brothers Wii U to get arbitrary ROP execution under userland

Can go over any fighter (and possibly article) to gain arbitrary code execution (Only ROP atm). This is a variation of contenthax based around MSC (the main character scripting language) exploiting a heap overflow to gain arbitrary read/write within the MSC script. Use [pymsc](https://github.com/jam1garner/pymsc) to build.
